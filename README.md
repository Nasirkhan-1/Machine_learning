Project: Salary Prediction Data Visualization

NumPy (numpy) – Although imported, it was not explicitly used in the code. It is commonly used for numerical computations.
Pandas (pandas) – Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot) – Used for data visualization, specifically to create a scatter plot.


Utilized Python and Pandas to load and preprocess a dataset containing salary information for various job positions.
Created a structured DataFrame to represent the relationship between job levels and corresponding salaries.
Developed a scatter plot visualization using Matplotlib to analyze salary trends across different hierarchical positions.
Implemented data-driven insights by labeling and formatting the visualization for better readability and interpretation.
Applied fundamental data science techniques to explore salary progression, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation and visualization.

Project: Salary Prediction Data Visualization

NumPy (numpy) – Although imported, it was not explicitly used in the code. It is commonly used for numerical computations.
Pandas (pandas) – Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot) – Used for data visualization, specifically to create a scatter plot.


Utilized Python and Pandas to load and preprocess a dataset containing salary information for various job positions.
Created a structured DataFrame to represent the relationship between job levels and corresponding salaries.
Developed a scatter plot visualization using Matplotlib to analyze salary trends across different hierarchical positions.
Implemented data-driven insights by labeling and formatting the visualization for better readability and interpretation.
Applied fundamental data science techniques to explore salary progression, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation and visualization.


Project: Regression Analysis on Student Scores Dataset
Description:

Utilized Python and Scikit-Learn to perform regression analysis on a student scores dataset.
Preprocessed data using Pandas, extracting independent variables (study hours, previous scores, etc.) and the dependent variable (final score).
Implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to predict student performance.
Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance.
Fine-tuned the Lasso Regression model by iterating over different alpha values to identify the optimal regularization parameter.
Evaluated model accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² score for training and test sets.
Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
Libraries Used:
Pandas – For data loading and preprocessing.
Matplotlib – (Imported but not used in this code). Typically used for data visualization.
Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso – For different regression models.
train_test_split – For splitting data into training and test sets.
metrics – For evaluating model performance (RMSE, R² score).
